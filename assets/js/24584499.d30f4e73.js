The conference held \\nin St. Louis, Missouri, featured a wide range of topics, including programming \\nlanguages, web development, artificial intelligence, distributed systems, and more.\\n\\nAbhilash Kotha and Sai Likhita Pulijala, second-year Master\'s students in Computer Science and Research Assistants with Open Source with SLU along with a few other students from the department had an opportunity to attend the event as volunteers. They not only contributed to the success of the event but also gained valuable experience in the process.  The two-day conference was full of opportunities for students. A few students were at the [Lemniscate sculpture](https://dgtized.github.io/lemniscate/) created by  [Ann Johnson](https://annjohnson.art/) and [Charles L.G. Comstock](https://github.com/dgtized) explaining the participants about the sculpture and answering any questions they had. The volunteers also assisted the organizers in distributing the merchandise and facilitating the book signing event on the second day of the event. They were able to connect with representatives from SafeStack, Strava, Swimm, Vonage, Improving, Capital One, Flexiana, John Deere and many other companies about their newest inventions and products.\\n\\n![Abhilash and other students with Charles L.G.

The sound of 3D printers hummed in the background. On an already busy Friday afternoon these students had elected to spend their time getting some hands on experiences with open source software. \\n\\nYash Bhatia, a second year Masters student in Computer Science and a Research Assistant with Open Source with SLU, handed out USB flash drives and printed instructions. Then he went [step-by-step](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QhlBWzoqiha1X8AogqNqMb4jynmaEDOAU2xmdrFD3Cc/edit?usp=sharing) with students down the path of creating a bootable flash drive with [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/). Elementry OS is a distribution of the Linux OS that touts itself as \\"The thoughtful, capable, and ethical replacement for Windows and macOS\\". Yash then walked those attending the workshop through actually using the flash drive they created as a [portable operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB). This is a technique where the user can plug and play the entire system on any desktop computer. He walked the group through a variety of use cases for a portable OS, and showed some of elementaryOS\'s capabilities as a portable operating system.\\n\\n![Yash introduces elementary OS](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_003.jpg)\\n![Students working together](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_001.jpg)\\n![Yash explaining details](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_005.jpg)\\n![Students all around the table](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_002.jpg)\\n![Yash assisting staff learning about OSS](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_004.jpg)\\n![3D printers printing in the background; possibly still printing the same job today.](./oss-atc-20230915/20230915_000.jpg)"},{"id":"ossci-panel-discussion","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/ossci-panel-discussion","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-07-10-ossci-panel-descussion.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-10-ossci-panel-descussion.md","title":"OSSci Panel Discussion - Accelerating Scientific Discovery","description":"Members from Open-Source Science (OSSci) were at Saint Louis University and our students had an opportunity to be panelists and organizing members for discussion.","date":"2023-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 10, 2023","tags":[{"label":"announcement","permalink":"/news/tags/announcement"},{"label":"news","permalink":"/news/tags/news"}],"readingTime":0.83,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Shown","title":"Program Director for Open Source with SLU","url":"https://github.com/kungfuchicken.com","imageURL":"/img/daniel_avatar.jpg","key":"daniel"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"OSSci Panel Discussion - Accelerating Scientific Discovery","description":"Members from Open-Source Science (OSSci) were at Saint Louis University and our students had an opportunity to be panelists and organizing members for discussion.","slug":"ossci-panel-discussion","authors":["daniel"],"tags":["announcement","news"],"image":"./oss-ossci-20230710/panel.jpg","hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Elementary OS Workshop","permalink":"/news/elementary-os"},"nextItem":{"title":"Starting Up","permalink":"/news/starting-up"}},"content":"Members from Open-Source Science (OSSci) were at Saint Louis University and our students had an opportunity to be panelists and organizing members for discussion.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**What:** <br/>\\n**Who:** [Abhilash Kotha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhilashkotha/), student in MS Computer Science and graduate research assistant at Open Source with SLU and [Raju Karmuri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajukarmuri731/) alumni and tech lead at Open-Source at SLU were part of the discussion panel<br/>\\n**When:** Monday, July 10 <br/>\\n**Where:** [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu/admission/visit/index.php)\\n**Resources:** [OSSci Website](https://opensource.science/)\\n\\nStudents had an incredible time as they had an opportunity to be panelists and organizing members at the Open-Source Science (OSSci) event at St. Louis University!
