Let me summarize it for you.</p><p><i>Pi Day is an annual celebration of the mathematical constant π. Pi Day is observed on March 14 since 3, 1, and 4 are the first three significant figures of π.</i></p><p>Here is a fun fact: March 14th is Albert Einstein's Birthday! One of science's greatest minds.</p><p>People across the world celebrate Pi Day by eating pie, hosting fun events, and holding community gatherings related to STEM. But what does this have to do with us? Well, we are contributing our special recipe to Raspberry Pi community.</p><p>We are coming up with a big announcement on Pi Day related to <a href="https://github.com/oss-slu/Pi4Micronaut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pi4Micronaut</a>.</p><p><strong>Stay Tuned!</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Baking at Open Source with SLU" src="/assets/images/baking@oss-slu-78173fe77e688bdef28644b09a33fac7.png" width="2938" height="1959" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OSS workshop about open source alternatives to everyday tools was conducted at ATC Pius library and it was a great success with 15 curious students joing the session and participating in the live demo. </p><p><strong>What:</strong> Exploring Open-Source Alternatives to Everyday IT Tools<br>
<strong>Who:</strong> Presentedy by <a href="https://yashb196.github.io/yashb196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abhilash Kotha</a>, MS student in Software Engineering and Graduate Research assistant at OSS SLU<br>
<strong>When:</strong> Friday, February 09<br>
2:00-3:00 p.m. (1 hour)<br>
<strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.slu.edu/library/services/academic-technology-commons/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pius Library, ATC</a><br>
<strong>Resources:</strong> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fNDAjl_kqJNfBmhCYkUlR2NOnjWYzf6r/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">presentation deck</a></p><p>In a recent workshop hosted by Abhilash Kotha, 15 curious students gathered to explore options in the world of open-source software. The workshop, organized by OSS, aimed to shed light on powerful alternatives to everyday tools like browsers, email clients, text editors, and even API testing tools.</p><p>The focus wasn't just on functionality but on the core values of open-source: transparency, collaboration, and freedom. By using open-source tools, participants learned about the benefits of knowing exactly what they're using, customizing it to their needs, and contributing to a vibrant community of developers.</p><p>The workshop wasn't just theoretical. Abhilash provided a live demo of installing open-source tools directly from GitHub, using their documentation. The audience witnessed the potential of Penpot, an open-source alternative to Figma, and even dabbled with Gpt4all, an open-source interface for open LLM models.</p><p>The energy in the room was profound. Participants actively engaged in discussions, asking questions and sharing their own experiences. It was clear that the message resonated, sparking a genuine interest in the possibilities of open-source technology.</p><i>"I always knew there were alternatives to tools like Chrome and Outlook but was always afraid to try them. I will definitely try them now,"</i> said Rutvik Mannem, tech lead at OSS, highlighting the positive takeaways.<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Abhilash looking at the camera while the participants are registering for the event" src="/assets/images/20240209_1-ec4220a1b8a73f7c515a5c3374db7f77.jpeg" width="4080" height="3072" class="img_ev3q">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>18 teams comprising 58 students put all their programming skills to work for a two-hour hackathon that took place on 27th November at Saint Louis University.</p><p><strong>What:</strong> <br>
<strong>Who:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhilashkotha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abhilash Kotha</a>, student in MS Computer Science and graduate research assistant organized the hackathon in collboration with global grad initiative at SLU<br>
<strong>When:</strong> Thursday, September 21 to Friday, September 22 (2 days)<br>
<strong>Where:</strong> <a href="https://www.slu.edu/admission/visit/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saint Louis University</a>

With the support of Dr. Eric Armbrecht, the founding director of the Global Grad initiative, Hackathon was organized by Abhilash Kotha and a dedicated team of 7 other MS students.</p><p>As part of the challenge, all the 18 teams tried to solve a real-time issue of grading scantron answer sheets. Orchestrated with the help of Dr. Kate Holdener and Mr. Daniel Shown, the challenge kept the participants busy for the entire duration. The prize money of $500 will be awarded to the winning team in the coming week once submissions have been reviewed.</p><p>Throughout the day, students collaborated and put their skills to practice, benefiting from the opportunity to solve practical problems and gain hands-on experience. Dr. Holdener and Mr. Shown visited the venue to support the student teams. They interacted with teams and clarified any doubts the students had about the requirements.</p><p>The hackathon concluded with Dr. Armbrecht distributing certificates of participation to the teams and applauding their efforts and engagement. Feedback from participants highlighted appreciation for the practical experience and the motivation they gained from working under such conditions. Describing his experience with the event, one of the participants Ramakanth said,</p><p>“This Hackathon was my first technical competition ever. Throughout the intense 2 hours, I learned so much from my teammates about collaborating under pressure to tackle a complex real-world problem. I am looking forward to more such events”</p><p>Any promising solutions produced as part of the students can potentially be used by Open Source with SLU in building an open source software product that automatically grades scantron answer sheets. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Mr. Daniel Shown explaining the requirements" src="/assets/images/daniel-fa493f96d02a9aaf6e444a7aec74b269.jpg" width="4080" height="3072" class="img_ev3q">

The sound of 3D printers hummed in the background. On an already busy Friday afternoon these students had elected to spend their time getting some hands on experiences with open source software. </p><p>Yash Bhatia, a second year Masters student in Computer Science and a Research Assistant with Open Source with SLU, handed out USB flash drives and printed instructions. Then he went <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QhlBWzoqiha1X8AogqNqMb4jynmaEDOAU2xmdrFD3Cc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">step-by-step</a> with students down the path of creating a bootable flash drive with <a href="https://elementary.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elementary OS</a>. Elementry OS is a distribution of the Linux OS that touts itself as "The thoughtful, capable, and ethical replacement for Windows and macOS". Yash then walked those attending the workshop through actually using the flash drive they created as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portable operating system</a>. This is a technique where the user can plug and play the entire system on any desktop computer. He walked the group through a variety of use cases for a portable OS, and showed some of elementaryOS's capabilities as a portable operating system.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Yash introduces elementary OS" src="/assets/images/20230915_003-8171ecc2dfc0647f654c323fb571e37a.jpg" width="4080" height="3072" class="img_ev3q">
